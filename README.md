## Introduction
In this project all the plots and visualizations are made in dashboard style, and interactive plots.
## Project Team
Jawaher Ibrahim Almotiran - Lulwah Ibrahim Altofail - Sarah Mohammad Aljowair - Bashayer Mohamed Alnemy.
## A Bit About Dataset
This data set describes the behavior of different users of STCTV for 2017-2018 year with different features and contains 1048575 rows.
### Data Cleaning
We removed data that was erroneous, corrupted, poorly formatted, duplicate, useless, or incomplete from a dataset.
### Data Sampling
We analyzed representative subset of all data in order to uncover the meaningful information in the larger data set. Our subset contains 219 rows.

## Insights
### Top 3 program genre
![top 3 program genre](https://github.com/jawaherIb/StcTV-Dashboard/assets/136590920/e726f55c-f7ec-43e8-a455-3d9a99fc5a46)

See here that after viewing the data it is easy and obvious to know the highest and lowest percentage of favorite movies by users. 
### Program class
Total watchers were 184.00 for movies and 35.00 for series, a total duration in seconds of 478,830.00 for movies and 39,396.00 for series.
So, users prefer movies over extended series and spend much longer watching movies than other series of all kinds.

## Summary
This Project is a pure visualization work where the customization and plotting features of Ploty were explored with the stc tv 2017-2018 Dataset. 
We have seen how the three types of movies that have received the highest attention from users can be known and whether they prefer series or movies and how long it takes to see them all. It was just a quick look at the perceptions that we made using Excel and by knowing them can make successful decisions.
